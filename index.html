    <h1>This is my dog, Boba.</h1>
    <div class=yup>
      <p>
      We got him from a family friend in late March, 2015. His parents are both farm dogs from Southern California. Don't ask us what his breed is, because we are not entirely sure. The vet says he is a labrador retriever and his curled tail tells us that he is also part akita. Prettiest mutt ever!
      </p>
      <p>
      Boba has a very energetic, airhead personality. He is huge and can seem scary, but he is the friendliest dog ever! He doesn't care much for other dogs, but love getting attention from humans. When playing outside, he is always living in his own world and it takes lots of treats to get his attention. Also, he likes to run away sometimes because he thinks he can survive without us (he can't).
